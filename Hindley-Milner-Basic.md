# Hindley Milner Basic type inference

This is an implementation of the Hindley Milner type checking algorithm based on the Scala code by Andrew Forrest, the Perl code by Nikita Borisov and the paper "Basic Polymorphic Typechecking" by Cardelli.  

This was the very first version that I came across and is served as a good introduction to the algorithms as the terms in the code match the terms described in the paper mentioned above.
