# Hindley Milner Mutable inference with row polymorphism

This is an implementation of type inference for safe, polymorphic and extensible records.  This code is based on the implementation [here](https://github.com/tomprimozic/type-systems/tree/master/extensible_rows).  Essentially this implementation is the same as [HMMutable](HMMutable) with row polymorphism added.  You can see the extension by examining the additional union case fields in the `expr` type that describe all the different operations that can be applied: `RecordSelect`, `RecordExtend`, `RecordRestrict` and `RecordEmpty`.  And again in `ty`: `TRecord `, `TRowEmpty` and `TRowExtend` byt looking at the usages of these types you can see which parts of the algorithm change.
