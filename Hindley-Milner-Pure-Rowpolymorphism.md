# Hindley Milner pure implementation with row polymorphism

This implementation is based on [Algorithm W step by step](ttps://github.com/wh5a/Algorithm-W-Step-By-Step/blob/master/AlgorithmW.pdf) by Martin Grabmuller with the addition of row polymorphism.  If you compare this implementation with [HMPure](HMPure/) you should be able to see the row polymorphism additions.  

## Code

All code is in a self contained project:
[HMPure-Rowpolymorphism](HMPure-Rowpolymorphism/)
